**Pair Coding**
## Introduction
In this research we will see the concept of pair coding because it was not found as such, the concept of pair programming or pair programming is seen, the breakdown of the research reveals the benefits of using this type of programming and the difficulties of is.
## Development
Consisting of two programmers working together on the same team. One of them (the driver) writes the code, while the other (observer) supervises it. Both programmers alternate these roles.
Pair programming is an agile technique that originates from extreme programming, in which two developers come together and work on one computer. The two people work together to design, code, and test user stories. Ideally, the two people would be equally skilled and each would have the same coding time.
Pair programming uses the four-eye principle, ensuring that two pairs of eyes review the code being produced even when there is a division of labor. While a person writes test cases using test-based development techniques.
### Advantage
The potential benefits are when you do it, how to do it right, and motivate yourself to do it in tough times. The main goals of the matchmaking can help you with the quality of the software and the flow of the team.

- better dissemination of knowledge among the team, particularly when a developer who is unfamiliar with a component is paired with one who knows it much better.
- Greater resilience of a peer to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: When one member of the peer must attend to an external prompt, the other can remain focused on the task and can help to regain focus afterwards.
- large reduction in coordination efforts.
- Knowledge exchange
- Maintain focus
- Code review on the fly
- Two modes of thinking combined
- Property of the Collective Code
- Keeps the WIP of the equipment low
- Quick onboarding of new team members
### Disadvantages
- Matchmaking can be exhausting
- Intense collaboration can be difficult
- Meeting interruptions
- Different skill levels
- Power dynamics
- Pairing with many Strangers
- There is no time for yourself
- Rotations lead to context change
- Matchmaking requires vulnerability
- Convince managers and coworkers
## Conclusion
It is a good way to work on a platform and be characterized with the work of your practices, in facilitating and obtaining the simplest possible understanding when both are working.

All this is a way to make fewer mistakes and more quality in the way of working.
