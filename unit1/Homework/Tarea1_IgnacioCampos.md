## 1. What is data mining and what is it for?
Data mining is the process of finding anomalies, patterns, and correlations in large data sets to predict outcomes. Employing a wide variety of techniques, you can use this information to increase your revenue, cut costs, improve your customer relationships, reduce risk, and more.
It also serves to filter out all the noise and repetitive in the data, understand that it is relevant and then make good use of the information to evaluate probable results, it accelerates the pace of informed decision making.

## 2. Where is data mining used?
- Forecast - Sales calculation and prediction of server loads or server downtime.
- Risk and probability: choosing the best clients for direct mail distribution, determining the probable breakeven point for risk scenarios, and assigning probabilities to diagnoses and other results.
- Recommendations: determination of the products that can be sold together and generation of recommendations.
- Sequence search: analysis of the items that customers have entered in the shopping cart and prediction of possible events.
- Grouping: distribution of customers or events into groups of related items, and analysis and prediction of affinities.

## 3. Applications of data mining?
- 'Marketing'. Data mining is used to explore growing databases and improve market segmentation. By analyzing the relationships between parameters such as customer age, gender, tastes, etc., it is possible to guess their behavior to direct personalized loyalty or recruitment campaigns. Data mining in marketing also predicts which users can unsubscribe from a service, what they are interested in based on their searches, or what a mailing list should include to achieve a higher response rate.
- Retail commerce. Supermarkets, for example, use joint purchasing patterns to identify product associations and decide how to position them in different aisles and shelves on the shelves. Data mining also detects which offers are the most valued by customers or increases sales in the checkout queue.
- Banking. Banks turn to data mining to better understand market risks. It is commonly applied to credit rating (rating) and intelligent anti-fraud systems to analyze transactions, card movements, purchase patterns and customer financial data. Data mining also allows banks to learn more about our preferences or habits on the Internet to optimize the return of their marketing campaigns, study the performance of sales channels or manage compliance obligations with regulations.
- Medicine. Data mining favors more accurate diagnoses. Having all of the patient's information — history, physical exam, and patterns of previous therapies — can prescribe more effective treatments. It also enables a more effective, efficient and economical management of health resources by identifying risks, predicting diseases in certain segments of the population or predicting the duration of hospital admission. Detecting fraud and irregularities and strengthening ties with patients by deepening the knowledge of their needs are also advantages of using data mining in medicine.
- Television and radio. There are networks that apply data mining in real time to their audience records on online television (IPTV) and radio. These systems collect and analyze anonymous information on channel views, broadcasts and programming on the fly. Thanks to data mining, it is possible to issue personalized recommendations to listeners and viewers, learn about their interests and their activity directly, and better understand their behavior. The chains also obtain very valuable knowledge for their advertisers, who take advantage of this data to reach their potential customers more precisely.
