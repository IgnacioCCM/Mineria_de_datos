## Evaluative Practice

#### We load the data from the dataframe into a variable to execute its values and give it the corresponding view
#### Project-Data.csv
```R
dataset <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

#### We will give a structure of the data with summary for a better analysis and observation.
```R
summary(dataset)
```

#### We will load the missing libraries for data manipulation.
```R
library(ggplot2)
```

```R

```

```R

```
